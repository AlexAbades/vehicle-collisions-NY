       <h1>Monthly time series plot for each category</h1>
</div>


<div style="text-align: justify;">
Generally, Larceny/Theft and Assault are the categories with the highest number of crimes. Namely, the Larceny/Theft crimes have doubled compared to the beginning of the period. In contrary, the most significant decrease of less than half of the number of incidents compared to the beginning of the period is observed in the Vehicle Theft, Drug/Narcotic and Prostitution categories.
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Starting with the Assault category, we can notice big fluctuations with large spikes over the years. In addition, the lower numbers of incidents reported predominantly in the winter months from December to February. In August 2017, we see the highest number of ASSAULT crimes which is equal to 1101 incidents.
<br>
According to Robbery category, from 2003 to June 2005, the number of reported robberies remained relatively stable, with a few spikes in certain months. However, from the aforementioned period onwards, there was a clear upward trend, with the number of reported robberies steadily increasing until peeking in June 2006 (429 crimes). After that, there was a rapid decrease in the number of reported robberies for six months, followed by fluctuations until the end of the period with the smallest spike in March 2016 (215 crimes).

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In terms of Vandalism, the overall trend shows a gradual increase in the number of reported incidents over time reaching a peak at 976 incidents in June 2017. One explanation is that this period reported high number of bike vandalisms as you can see in this article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/21/bike-sharing-scheme-san-francisco-gentrification-vandalism">'It's not for me': how San Francisco's bike-share scheme became a symbol of gentrification</a>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In the next plot, the number of reported burglaries reached a peak at 696 incidents in January 2005. However, from August 2006 onwards, there was a clear downward trend, with the number of reported burglaries steadily decreasing until hitting a low of 309 incidents in February 2011. Afterwards, there was a slight increase in incidents until November 2012, followed by a relatively stable period until the end. 
<br>
<br>

In Stolen Property graph, the number of reported crimes remains stable at roughly 50 incidents until 30 April 2011. Then, there was a clear upward trend, with the number of reported incidents steadily increasing until October 2013 with 119 incidents have been reported (you can read more in this article: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-aa2-snapshot-sf-crime-20141120-story.html">San Francisco sees sharp rise in property and violent crimes - Los Angeles Times</a>, followed by a steadily decrease until the end of the period (56 incidents).

<div style="text-align: justify;">
According to vehicle theft category, we notice that number of crimes increased from the beginning of the period, reaching a high at 1714 incidents in November 2005, followed by a sharply decrease at 567 crimes in February 2006. This trend confirmed by this article<a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/02/18/auto-thefts-in-state-decline-for-first-time-in-decade-2/">Auto thefts in state decline for first time in decade</a>. Regarding to this article, many residents started to purchase devices that lock vehicles, as well as purchasing vehicle theft and tracking/security systems. Continuing the trend description, the number of reported incidents of this category remained relatively stable for the rest of the period. 
<br>
<br>

According to the Prostitution crimes, the trend follows similar pattern with Drug/Narcotic category having more fluctuations with bigger spikes at the beginning of the period. In July 2008, there were the high of 223 prostitution crimes, and this number steadily decreased over the next few years to reach a low of 53 in November 2011. However, after this year, the number of prostitution incidents remained stable around the 50 incidents until the end of the period. The reason for the reduction in this type of crime could be with the creation of programs  like “john School” by educating “johns,” men arrested for soliciting prostitutes, about the negative consequences of prostitution <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/reducing-demand-prostitution-san-francisco-john-school-program">Reducing Demand for Prostitution in San Francisco With a “John School” Program | National Institute of Justice </a>. 
<br>
<br>

The monthly analysis of Weapon Laws trend shows that the number of weapon laws incidents fluctuated over the years, but generally showed a slightly increasing trend from the middle of period. Specifically, the Weapon Laws crimes reached a low of 55 incidents in February 2011, followed by an increase reaching at 171 incidents at the end of the period. 
<br>
Regarding to the Larceny/Theft incidents graph, the number of crimes remain stable around 2000 incidents from the beginning of the period to March 2012, followed by a steadily increase to 4457 incidents in October 2017. Confirming this trend by this article: <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/why-did-sf-have-among-highest-increases-in-larceny-in-the-state-in-early-2013/article_b8643545-8d94-5389-aa35-960dce895d6d.html">Why did SF have among highest increases in larceny in the state in early 2013</a> which confirms that San Francisco police started to report a significant increase in Larceny/Theft incidents in early 2013 probably due to a change in reporting methods or due to link to the spike in cell phone thefts.

Drunkness, which is categorized as a type of disorderly conduct, has varied in the San Francisco city from the years 2003 to 2017.  
In the early years, the number of reported drunkness incidents hovered around 2,000 cases per year. However, in 2009, the city saw a spike in the number of incidents, with 3,354 reported cases. This high point was followed by a decrease in incidents over the next several years, with the number of reported cases dropping to 2,580 in 2014. Afterwards, the amount of drunkness incidets reached another peak with 3,356 incidents. The spikes could be attributed to a number of factors, including a surge in tourism, nightlife, and the use of ride-sharing services, which may have made it easier for people to go out and drink without worrying about how they would get home. After 2015 and until 2017 the number of drunkess remain somhow stable around the 3000 incidents.

Aditionally, we analysed what happened with the driving under the influence crimes. For the 2013 to 2017 period San Francisco saw a fluctuation in the number of incidents reported. From 2003 San Franciso had a positive trend for this crime type, arriving into a peak of 1318 incidents in February 2005. This could potentially be due to a lack of awareness about the dangers of drunk driving or less strict enforcement of DUI laws.  <br>
After that peak, people apparently began to be more self-conscious, as the amount of incidents steadily decreased in he next years, arriving to 393 incidents in August 2013. After 2013, the amount of incidents remained stable with occasional fluctuations, but with a neutral trend. <br>
We could say that the continuously effort from the enforcement agencies to drop down the amount of incidents yielded results on changing the social attitude towards drinking and driving. 
<br>
<br>
Disorderly conduct is a broad term used to describe a variety of disruptive behaviours, including public intoxication, disturbing the peace, and causing a disturbance in public places. <br>
During this time period, the number of disorderly conduct incidents reported in San Francisco varied from year to year. In some years, the number of incidents decreased, while in other years, the number increased. However, overall, the trend was an increase in the number of incidents report-ed over the 15-year period. <br>
The data suggests that the highest number of disorderly conduct incidents occurred in 2017, with over 6,000 reported incidents. This was a significant increase from the approximately 2,000 incidents reported in 2003. 
<br>
<br>

Confirming this trend, State Sen. Scott Wiener announced a bill on 30 March 2017 that would increase penalties for professional sporting event attendees who trespass onto the field or court according to this article: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-bill-would-increase-penalties-for-disrupting-sporting-events/">California Bill Would Increase Penalties For Disrupting Sporting Events</a> probably resulting in a decrease in incidents in the upcoming period.

       <h1>Prostitution Category: Map analysis</h1>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Afterwards, we would like to investigate more about the Prostitution category. Using the map above, we discovered the most suspicious areas where this type of crime occurs. Using two different time periods, we displayed the incidents in the map from 2007-2009 in red colour and from 2016 to 2017 in blue colour respectively. We chose the period from 2007 to 2009 because this period has the highest number of incidents according to the aforementioned monthly time series plot. According to the map visualization, it is clear that the high-incident area shifted from north-central San Francisco to south-central along the Van Ness Avenue. In map, we can notice that in 2016-2017 period there are many incidents in the area enclosed by 7th, Mission, 21st and Folsom streets. The purpose of this analysis is to inform residents and police officers of the high probability that this type of crime will occur in this region the upcoming period.

       <h1>Analysis of the crimes by hour</h1>
</div>


<div style="text-align: justify;">
Below we are presented with the hourly bar plot of crimes committed in the different districts of San Francisco. Starting with the Bayview district, the hourly plot shows that most crimes occur during the late afternoon and early evening hours, with the peak occurring between 4 pm and 7 pm. The number of reported incidents decreases during the early morning hours and reaches its lowest point between 3 am and 5 am.
All the other districts follow a pretty similar trend, with slightly different peaks (e.g. some might have their peaks at 5 pm while others at 6 pm), and slightly shifted lows. However, in some cases the pattern might vary to some degree. For example, in the Northern and Southern districts, although the plots have a similar behavior to the one described above, the number of reported incidents remains relatively high during the late evening hours and early morning hours.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Almost every plot (except for the Tenderloin District) has two mysterious sudden changes. The first one is a sharp increase of the number of crimes at 12 am (about 25% increase), and the other one is a sudden decrease of the number of crimes at 1am (more or less 50% decrease). After doing some research online, nothing was found that could describe these behaviors, so we tried to come up with some plausible scenarios that could explain these trends. So these could either be a human error (rounding the reported time towards 12 am) or there were shift changes happening during those hours, or it could just be a regular thing that crime rises (or drops) during those hours.
